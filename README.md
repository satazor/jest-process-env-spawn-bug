# Instructions

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

2. Run `index.js`

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    You should see
    ```
    result1 Hello
    result2 Hello
    ```

3. Run tests

    ```bash
    npm t
    ```

    Second test fails but it shouldn't. The same code outside Jest works!
